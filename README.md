## ‚úÖ Project Setup Checklist
1. **Clone the repository in `01 - DEVELOPMENT` to setup the folder structure:**
2. **Store raw data in the `data` folder.**
3. **Use the `scripts` folder for data processing scripts.**
4. **Store intermediate and final outputs in the `outputs` folder.**
5. **Use the `temp_files` folder for temporary data or scratch files.**
6. **Move final deliverables to `00 - FINAL DELIVERABLE`.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines
- Store raw and cleaned data in `01 - DEVELOPMENT/Data`.
- Develop and test notebooks in the `notebooks` folder.
- Store all final outputs in the `outputs` folder.
- Keep processing scripts organized in the `scripts` folder.
- Use the `temp_files` folder for scratch files or intermediary data that can be deleted.
- Include instructions for how stakeholder can clone/connet to repository `how_to_connect_to_project_git_repo.ipynb`.
- Use Jupyter Notebooks/notebooks of choice or Python scripts for data processing in `01 - DEVELOPMENT/Notebooks`.
- Scripts should follow naming conventions: `data_extraction.py`, `data_cleaning.py`, etc.
- Ensure that all code is well-documented and includes error handling.
- Keep the `00 - FINAL DELIVERABLE` folder in the main repository clean and only for final outputs.

## üöÄ Deployment and Handoff
- Move all final deliverables to `00 - FINAL DELIVERABLE`.
- Include a final presentation in `00 - FINAL DELIVERABLE/Presentations`.
