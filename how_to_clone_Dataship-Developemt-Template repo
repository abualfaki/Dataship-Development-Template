### üì¶ Prerequisites
- Google Drive for Desktop installed
- GitHub account
- Git installed locally
- Access to the `My Drive` location on your machine
- The main project folder with `00 - FINAL DELIVERABLE` and `01 - DEVELOPMENT` subfolders already set up

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Install Google Drive for Desktop
- Download from: [Google Drive for Desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/)
- Sign in with the same Google account used for Colab.
- Choose either 'Stream' or 'Mirror' files.

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Sync the Project Folder to Google Drive
- Access the shared folder or create a new folder named `# - Project Name - TEMPLATE` under your project structure in My Drive:
  - `My Drive/# - Project Name - TEMPLATE`

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Navigate to the `01 - DEVELOPMENT` Folder using command line or terminal on mac
- The `01 - DEVELOPMENT` folder already exists within the project structure handed to you. Navigate to it using the following command:
  ```bash
  cd ~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-your_email@gmail.com/My\ Drive/#\ -\ Project\ Name\ -\ TEMPLATE
  
  cd "01 - DEVELOPMENT"  # Navigate to the development folder where the repository will be cloned
  ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Clone the Repository
- Ensure the `01 - DEVELOPMENT` folder is empty before cloning:
  ```bash
  cd ~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-your_email@gmail.com/My\ Drive/#\ -\ Project\ Name\ -\ TEMPLATE/01\ -\ DEVELOPMENT
  git clone https://github.com/abualfaki/Datship-Development-Template.git .
  ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 5: Set Up Git Remotes
- Verify the current remotes:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
- If the remote is not set or needs to be updated:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/abualfaki/Datship-Development-Template.git
  ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 6: Create a New Branch (Optional but Recommended especially if working with multiple developers)
  ```bash
  git checkout -b development
  ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 7: Push Initial Commit
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit with folder structure"
  git push -u origin development
  ```

### üõ†Ô∏è You should now see all the folders in the Datship-Development-Template repo in your Google Drive.

### ‚úÖ Notes and Best Practices
- Ensure the project folder is located in `My Drive` for sync to work properly.
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files like `.DS_Store` and Colab checkpoints.
- Always use feature branches for specific tasks to avoid conflicts.
- Verify the folder structure before proceeding with any data uploads or script executions.
